            <hr>
            <p>The price of technology reaches far beyond the money paid for new hardware. Every laptop, cell-phone, and smart-watch is made in a factory somewhere by someone. It is easy to disconnect that fact from the shrink wrap and satisfaction obtained after sliding a new box cover off of an XTech XPhone. Unfortunately, one of XTech’s main manufacturers, Foxconn, has been accused of human rights violations in terms of the working conditions that employees of Foxconn are subject to. </p>

            <h2 class="capitalize">Introduction</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>The XPhone and XBook Pro are XTech’s highest selling products and are both manufactured in China by Foxconn. Foxconn is a manufacturing company that has experience working with large tech corporations including but not limited to XTech, Apple, and Amazon. Foxconn provides premium manufacturing at an affordable price. However, in light of recent news, XTech is faced with an ethical dilemma. Foxconn’s means of providing their service violate the very core of XTech’s values and principles.

                <h4>Child Labor:</h4>
                <p>China has many laws set in place to protect children from being taken advantage of in the workplace. For starters, work eligibility begins at 16 and overtime as well as night shifts are illegal for minors to take part in. Foxconn is accused of using illegal child labor in the form of “hundreds of schoolchildren” and implementing illegal overtime for minors as described in [1]. These allegations are serious and were unknown to XTech when executing previous contracts with Foxconn. </p>
                
                <h4>Labor Conditions:</h4>
                <p>Investigating Foxconn’s child labor practices has lead to the discovery of more injustices being served to Foxconn employees. From the child labor previously discussed, to wage exploitation, serious worksite accidents, and alarming employee suicide rates as outlined in [2], it is evident that Foxconn is not the company that XTech believed to be doing business with.</p>
                
                <h4>Stakeholders:</h4>
                <p>Obviously XTech and Foxconn are not compatible companies. However, Foxconn and XTech have thrived as business partners and a disbanding has serious implications. A decision must be made regardless and many will be affected as a result.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Foxconn - As a company, Foxconn stands to lose millions in lawsuits and potential opportunity costs.</li>
                    <li>Foxconn Employees - Foxconn employees are faced with potentially losing the paycheck that puts food on their families table.</li>
                    <li>XTech - XTech as a company will be forced to adjust moral principles or uproot years of business and infrastructure to find a new manufacturing company. This dramatic change will likely affect the price of XTech products and as a result, the consumer base is threatened.</li>
                    <li>XTech Consumers - Similar to XTech as a company, the consumers of XTech products will have to adjust their moral values or prepare to spend more money for the same product.</li>
                </ul>

            <h2 class="capitalize">Discussion</h2>
            <hr>
            <h4>Consequentialism</h4>
            <p>Despite the serious allegations against Foxconn, the value of the machines they manufacture far outweigh the conditions that workers are subject to. In addition, many of these workers would be substantially worse off without Foxconn there to provide a paycheck. Creating a formula it is obvious to see that sustainability in the form of a paycheck and high quality machines staying at an affordable price for innovating Americans far outweigh the labor condition allegations. XTech will take a consequentialist view and pursue an avenue where the future is prioritized because “what is best or right is whatever makes the world best in the future”[3]. From this definition, XTech knows that the world will be better off with affordable technology and wages in otherwise desperate areas of the globe. As a result, XTech will continue to work with Foxconn in the manufacturing of all technologies to ensure affordable hardware and keep many jobs alive in Foxconn. Draping a veil of ignorance over this ethical theory, it is flawed from the beginning. XTech is providing profit to a company that is exploiting employees. If something is not broken, there is no need to fix this. Foxconn will likely continue these elicit practices and conditions may even get worse.</p>
            <h4>Care Ethics</h4>
            <p>From a perspective of care ethics, care is described as “sentiment, a personal virtue, or a relational value”[4]. Thus we are all related as humans and no human being should be subject to work in unfit conditions. It is in no way virtuous and understandably ‘wrong’ as any individual can empathize with a lack of equity in the workplace. XTech can not support a company that does not provide a standard working condition that is suitable for human beings. As a result, XTech will pursue other manufacturing plants and although the endeavor will be costly, it is the only solution if human life is truly valued. Including the veil of ignorance, this ethical approach based in care has no flaws. Still no government agency is being taken advantage of in the deficit of the people. This truly is the solution.</p>
            <h4>Cultural Relativism</h4>
            <p>Being a stranger in a foreign land is often overwhelming to first-timers. Cultures, languages, and steadfast beliefs vary in different parts of the world. In defense of Foxconn, “what is considered right in one culture may be considered wrong in another”[5]. It truly is not XTech’s business to be involved with the culture and practices of another country. Assuredly there are American cultures and values that China does not even tolerate in their media. Who is to say which culture is right? XTech believes it is neither country’s duty or right to criticize or enforce one’s cultural norms on another. It is fine to not understand another country, but to criticize its beliefs and way of life is not entertainable for an outsider. Thus, XTech will continue to shed no judgment on Foxconn's cultural way of business and Foxconn will continue to manufacture XTech products. Adding a blindfold of justice element it is clear that Foxconn is abusing the governmental systems put in place to protect workers, but again, it is not for XTech to decide if Foxconn is truly off base in their practices. These dealings should still be left to their own culture.</p>

            <h2 class="capitalize">Conclusion</h2>
            <hr>
            <p>In the end, cultural relativism does need to be taken into account. However, Foxconn is breaking laws set in place by their own culture's government. Thus cultural relativism meets an end and the only solution to move forward is to keep XTech consistent and utilize a care ethics strategy once again. XTech can not move forward as a company knowing that they are enabling the exploitation of hard workers that don’t have many options in terms of employment to buy the necessities of life. As a human company, XTech can not subjugate other humans to injustice. Moving forward, XTech product prices may rise, but it is for the care of the human race.</p>
