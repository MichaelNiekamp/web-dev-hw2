                Home is where I want to be
                Pick me up and turn me round
                I feel numb, burn with a weak heart
                I guess I must be having fun
                The less we say about it the better
                Make it up as we go along
                Feet on the ground
                Head in the sky
                It's ok I know nothing's wrong... nothing
                Hi yo I got plenty of time
                Hi yo you got light in your eyes
                And you're standing here beside me
                I love the passing of time
                Never for money
                Always for love
                Cover up + say goodnight... say goodnight
                ...
                Home, is where I want to be
                But I guess I'm already there
                I come home, she lifted up her wings
                Guess that this must be the place
                I can't tell one from another
                Did I find you, or you find me?
                There was a time before we were born
                If someone asks, this where I'll be where I'll be
                Hi yo we drift in and out
                Hi yo sing into my mouth
                Out of all those kinds of people
                You got a face with a view
                I'm just an animal looking for a home
                Share the same space for a minute or two
                And you love me till my heart stops
                Love me till I'm dead
                Eyes that light up, eyes look through you
                Cover up the blank spots
                Hit me on the head ah ooh
